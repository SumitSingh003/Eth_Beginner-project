# Create a Token

'Future' token smart contract for transactions

## Description

The purpose of this smart contract is to administer the "Future" token, also known as "FTR" for short. With the minting and burning processes, it facilitates the creation and administration of tokens. The contract keeps track of the whole token supply and keeps track of the addresses and token balances associated with them. If they have enough tokens to burn, users can mint more tokens to increase their balance and the overall supply, or they can burn tokens to lower both.

## Executing program

* Copy the code and paste it on remix.etherum.org
* Make sure it is compatible with the current version of the compiler
* Compile the code (or press 'ctrl + S' for compilation)
* Deploy the contract (Compile and Deploy options are on the left side of the screen)
* Use the deployed contract as per your wish.

## Help

Make sure the contract is compatible with the current version of your compiler. (>=0.8.7 is common)
